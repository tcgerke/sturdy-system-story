Once upon a time, there was a guy named Jimbo who lived in the Alaskan wilderness. Jimbo was thirsty, so he decided he would go to the store and buy a refreshing beverage. So, Jimbo left his house and walked through three feet of snow for two hours, only to remember that he lived one hundred miles from civilization and that there were no stores nearby.
