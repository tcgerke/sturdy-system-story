Once upon a time, there was a guy named Jimbo who lived in the Alaskan wilderness. Jimbo was thirsty, so he decided he would go to the store and buy a refreshing beverage. So, Jimbo left his house and walked through three feet of snow for two hours, only to remember that he lived one hundred miles from civilization and that there were no stores nearby.
He realized that he was in huge danger because of the coldness. The food he brings no longer support him to stay outside for too long. Right now, he had to make a choice between two different roads. The first road is a safe but long road that the food will not support him to finish all the distance, but he had some chance to hunt on this way. The second road is a short but dangerous road that he may be attacked by wild animals. Both roads connect him to the nearest civilization. If you were Jimbo, what will you do?
